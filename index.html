                                    Terrorism starts with a vulnerable person becoming attracted to individuals, groups, or 
                                    causes. New ways of thinking, driven by those who want to exploit that person's trust; who 
                                    focus in on that person's grievances or desires and say they have an apparent means to 
                                    address it.<br> They promote ideologies that go against our shared values; that encourage 
                                    intolerance and even glorify acts of violence.<br> These ideologies might claim political 
                                    views or distort religion to draw vulnerable people in. But however it’s presented, the 
                                    objective is the same: to incite someone to support terrorism, or perhaps become a 
                                    terrorist themselves.<br> That might start with the lure of belonging. A promise of an 
                                    increased status; the chance to impress their friends, or satisfy a need for excitement 
                                    and purpose.<br> Because, often, those vulnerable to radicalisation feel disillusioned. 
                                    Just like other young people, they are seeking answers, or that chance to re-invent or 
                                    prove themselves.<br> And it's that willingness for change which means they rarely see 
                                    the direction they are heading in.

                                Here are some examples of changes in behaviour that may indicate radicalisation in a person.
                                <br>There could be many different drivers behind these types of changes in behaviour, not 
                                just radicalisation. So, it's important to understand why these changes are happening, before 
                                jumping to any conclusions.

                        long-established safeguarding duties and is part of the Counter-Terrorism 
                        and Security Act (2015). The Prevent duty is designed to help ensure that 
                        people who are susceptible to radicalisation are as supported as they 
                        would be under safeguarding processes. It means that specified authorities 
                        such as education, health, local authorities, police and criminal justice 
                        agencies (prisons, probation and youth justice) have a duty to help stop 
                        people being radicalised into terrorism.</p>
