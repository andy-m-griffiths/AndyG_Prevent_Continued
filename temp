                    <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">The aim of Prevent is to stop people 
                        from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. Prevent sits alongside
                        long-established safeguarding duties and is part of the Counter-Terrorism 
                        and Security Act (2015). The Prevent duty is designed to help ensure that 
                        people who are susceptible to radicalisation are as supported as they 
                        would be under safeguarding processes. It means that specified authorities 
                        such as education, health, local authorities, police and criminal justice 
                        agencies (prisons, probation and youth justice) have a duty to help stop 
                        people being radicalised into terrorism.</p>

                    <p class="text-center kodchasan-semibold small">Myth: Prevent targets specific 
                        faiths or ethnic groups</p>
                    <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">Prevent does not target a specific 
                        faith or ethnic group. It addresses the ideological causes of terrorism 
                        and deals with all kinds of terrorist threats to the UK.</p>
                    <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">There is a focus on Islamist and extreme 
                        right-wing ideologies and the people and behaviours associated with them, as 
                        they represent the greatest threat to the UK. Other ideologies are less 
                        present, but still have the potential to be used to justify terrorism.</p>
                    <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">Prevent is mainly delivered at the 
                        community level through the local authority and partners in education and 
                        healthcare. This ensures that radicalisation risks are properly understood 
                        within the local context.</p>
